# RblxBadgeCrossChecker
This is just a theory for a osint tool, this tool is meant for detecting how often they play together making it more upfront on how close their bond is. (The more badges both of the players have the more badges will match) then with the data it shows it allows you to come to the conclusion of if they are close and how close they are.
